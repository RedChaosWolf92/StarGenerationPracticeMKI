# StarGenerationPracticeMKI

4th or 5th iteration of this idea, finally taking form. 
offical first iteration of this star generation where by randomly choosing which star to call on from Stars node which contain child nodes of 8 different kind of stars. 

second iteration will be improvement of the first iteration with a more fuller view of 100 stars regardless of viewport size. will also include Path2D nodes in each child node of 'Stars' Node.
## there will be visual paths connecting to each stars, based on star limitation of paths
## the stars will be generated in a simple spirl pattern, similar to milky way galaxy.
